### 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### Constraints:

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-   -100 <= Node.val <= 100
