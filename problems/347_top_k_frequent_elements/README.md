# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
    Output: [1,2]

### Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1], k = 1
    Output: [1]

### Constraints:

-   1 <= nums.length <= 105
-   -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
-   k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
-   It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

### How to compile

    g++ -std=c++17 -o main main.cpp

### How to run

    ./main
